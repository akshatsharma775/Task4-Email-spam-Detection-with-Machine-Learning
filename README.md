# OIBSIP Task4-Email-spam-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for detecting and filtering spam emails. By leveraging various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods, the goal is to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) with high accuracy. This project is designed to improve email security and user experience by reducing the likelihood of harmful or unwanted messages reaching users' inboxes.

Problem Statement
Email spam detection is a critical task in maintaining secure and efficient communication. Spam emails often contain malicious content, phishing attempts, or unwanted advertisements, posing risks to users and organizations. Traditional rule-based spam filters can be bypassed by sophisticated spam techniques. Therefore, the objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham, using features extracted from email text and metadata.

Objectives

    .Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features from email content, subject lines, and metadata to distinguish spam from ham.
    .Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, to identify the best-performing model for spam detection.
    .Model Optimization: Optimize the selected model to balance precision and recall, minimizing both false positives and false negatives.
    .Real-Time Implementation: Explore strategies for deploying the model in a real-time email filtering system, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
